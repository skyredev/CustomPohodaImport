/*
    Path: src/client/css/main.css

    Description:

    This is the main CSS file, it's the entry point for ESBuild.
    All other CSS files should be imported here via @import, if you want to use them.
    ESBuild will bundle all imported CSS files including this one into a single file.

    This file has to be appended to metadata/app/client.json, example below:

    {
        "cssList": [
            "__APPEND__",
            "client/modules/<module-name>/css/main.css"
        ]
    }

    (If not required, you can remove this file and the metadata/app/client.json entry.)
